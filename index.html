            <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
            <p>Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of death of an estimated 17 million, anually, around the globe according to the WHO.</p>
            <p>Heart failure, which occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to sustain other bodily functions, make up a significant</p>
            <p>portion of cardiovascular disease-related deaths. Heart failure patients provide an opportunity for the medical community to record</p>
            <p>and quantify medical symptoms, clinical laboratory test outputs, and physical features. We can run analysis on these datasets to find</p>
            <p>to find correlations between various features and predict outcomes of heart failures. In this project, we use machine learning</p>
            <p>on a dataset of heart failure patients admitted to the Institute of Cardiology and Allied hospital Faisalabad-Pakistan during April-December 2015.</p>

        <h3>BACKGROUND ON THE DATASET</h3>
        <p>The dataset used for our study is derived from heart failure patients admitted to the
          Institute of Cardiology and Allied Hospital Faisalabad-Pakistan from April to December of 2015.
          All patients are aged 40 years, or olders, and were suffering NYHA class III or IV left ventricular 
          systolic dysfunction at the time the data was recorded. These are all follow-up visits to the institute.
        </p>
        <p>For each patient, the following features were recorded during their heart failure event:
          Age, Ejection Fraction, Serum Creatinine, Serum Sodium, Anemia, Platelets, Creatinine Phosphokinase, 
          Blood Pressure, Gender, Diabetes, and Smoking Status. Whether or not the incident lead to a Death Event 
          is also recorded. We used regression analysis and machine learning to evaluate the statistical importance
          of each feature is when evaluating mortality of the patients listed in the dataset.
        </p>
        <p>This dataset was collected and studied using Cox regression in a study titled:
          "Survival analysis of heart failure patients: A case study"

          <h3>METHODS</h3>
          <p>Our analysis is aimed at predicting death events of patients experiencing heart failure and surveying
            the importance of features exhibited by each during the recorded heart failure event.</p>
          <p>Since linear regression gives us a continuous output, we chose to apply logistic regression's
             Maximum Likelihood Estimation approach to the dataset. Linear regression analysis also provides
            us the ability to evaluate the importance of each feature in predicting the binary survival outcome.</p>
          <p>We also used random forest machine learning on the dataset because it proved to be the top classifying machine learning
            technology available to us.

        <h3>REGRESSION ANALYSIS & MACHINE LEARNING RESULTS - SURVIVAL</h3>
        <p>After removing the Death Event column from our dataset, we split the data for training and testing.
          We then proceeded to run logistic regression and random forest machine learning analysis on the dataset.
        </p>
        <p>Both our logistic regression and random forest analysis came back with scores of .8 or above for predicting 
          mortality of the test data.
        </p>
        <p>Overall, random forest proved to be slightly better at predicting the survival of a patient than logistic regression.
          But, but methods left us with scores of .8 or higher which leads us to believe, when evaluating patients returning for care 
          after a previous heart event, both methods can achieve similar results when given the same input information.

          <h3>REGRESSION ANALYSIS & MACHINE LEARNING RESULTS - FEATURES</h3>
          <p>We found four different features that played a prominent part in predicting the survival of a patient
            in our data: Time, Serum Creatinine, Ejection Fraction, and Age. With some minor disagreements between 
            the logistic regression and random forest models used, the combination of these four features ranked highest 
            in importance.
          </p>
          <p>Separating the top three or five features and retesting on that data did not give us any better results however.
            In fact, testing using less features actually decreased the accuracy of both logistic regression and random forest
            models. This leads us to believe that the remaining features, with diminished importance, still play a key role 
            in being able to predict a patient's survivability.</p>

        <h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3>
        <p>Before we dive into conclusions reached by our analysis we need to talk about weaknesses of the dataset.
          The dataset reviewed was not split evenly by gender and the dataset is fairly small. With only 299 patients 
          observed, we can infer that a larger dataset would provide more reliable results. Additional information about 
          patients would also contribute to stronger modeling such as: height, weight, body mass index, etc. The dataset
          also doesn't list other traits that may be characteristic of heart failure such as family history or alcohol intake.
        </p>
        <p>Time, far and away, was the most important feature. This dataset monitors patients that are returning to the institute
          for treatment for another heart failure. The time column measures the time in between the first and second visit.
          the sooner patients return for heart failure, the lower the survival rate tends to be. Serum Creatinine (associated
          with renal function) and Ejection Fraction (the amount of blood pumped out of the ventricle with each contraction)
          also carry significant importance within the models. Scientists who've committed traditional biostatistics analysis to
          the same dataset have also selected these features as the two most relevant. This provides us a high level of confidence
          that random forest and regression analysis can be effective tools when attempting to predict the survival rate of similar 
          heart failure patients when given the same kind of data.
