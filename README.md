# HEART HEALTH DATA MODELING PROJECT

### CONTRIBUTORS: ERIK WATSON, ASHWINI KAMAT, NEAL TARVER

## PROJECT GOAL:

The main goal of this project is to utilize regression analysis and machine learning on a dataset of heart failure patients to find out how accurately we can predict survivability of a NYHA class III or IV heart failure. We also aim to find the most important features within the dataset that contribute to survivability, or which characteristics factor most in the survivability of these types of events.

## Our Dataset

The dataset is derived from heart failure patients admitted to the Institute of Cardiology and Allied Hospital Faisalabad-Pakistan from April to December of 2015. The institute captured data on patients suffering from an NYHA class III or IV left ventricular stystolic dysfunction (type of heart failure) that had previously been under care for a similar heart failure event. The features captured are listed below. Our group found the dataset used on Kaggle. The authors of the Kaggle page sighted the original study. We've linked both below.
